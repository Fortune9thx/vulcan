Windows compatibility shim for gltest's direct-mode message injection.

gltest.direct.loader._inject_message_to_fd0 (genlayer-test==0.29.2) does:
    os.dup2(fd, 0)   # duplicate the temp file's fd onto stdin
    os.close(fd)     # close the original fd
    os.unlink(path)  # delete the temp file

On POSIX this works because unlinking an open file just removes the
directory entry while the still-open fd (now living at fd 0) keeps the
data alive. On Windows, os.unlink refuses to remove a file that any
handle still has open - fd 0 still points at it via dup2 - so this raises
PermissionError (WinError 32) on every direct-mode contract deploy.

This is an upstream bug in the library, not in the contract under test.
We patch os.unlink to swallow exactly that failure so test collection
can proceed; the OS will actually delete the temp file once fd 0 is
closed/reused at process exit.

Vulcan.py uses only gl.nondet.exec_prompt / gl.vm.run_nondet_unsafe, not
gl.eq_principle.prompt_non_comparative or web rendering, so the
ExecPromptTemplate/WebRender wasi_mock gaps documented elsewhere for other
projects don't apply here and are deliberately not patched.
